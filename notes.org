mightyohm vs. libellium/sparkfun vs. CCFL

mightyohm equivs: 

1N4937 - NTE552
FJN3303F - STX13001/3/5, MJE13005, FJP13009, BUL216
1N914 - 1N4148 
2N3904 - 2N2222

555 must be CMOS - TLC 555 smd

for CCFL use 1W 200v zeners and 10Nf 1kv caps... (also for libel/sparkfun)

SBM-20 - 400v (350-450), dead time = 190 microsec, 5M anode resistance

* panel

128.5 mm high // wide=

perspex...

size as need separate digital from HV PSU and tube!

* TODO

- PSU tests and schematic
- footprints for switch, fuse-geiger holder, transformer or other PSU parts, outline for sample holder/resin block
