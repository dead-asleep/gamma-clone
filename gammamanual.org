*\gamma*

\noindent Extending the explorations of material process and ever
viral code initiated by the micro_research ERD series, ERD/\gamma digs the
Eurorack synth deep into geological time scales of radioactive
decay. The module provides a radioactive source (Uraninite
aka. Pitchblende), Geiger counter and processing to deliver both pure
random voltages and random timing/triggers.

Given the half life of the isotopes within the active material
(Uranium-238 and Uranium-235) the module must be returned for
recalibration in perhaps a few billion years.

According to selected mode (four CV modes) ERD/\gamma outputs a scaled
random control voltage (0-5v) either at specific adjusted time deltas,
or at scaled random times. A low entropy mode allows for faster random
CV out (maximum 100-150Hz as compared to 10-20Hz). A trigger mode
supplies the last available random voltage on trigger in (rising
edge). A dedicated trigger out provides a 5v pulse (200uS duration) at
random scaled intervals (at zero speed scale each pulse mirrors a beta
decay event at the geiger tube). Timing and voltage scales are under
CV control; local entropy can thus be reduced.

\noindent Any atomic or sub-atomic change within materials implies a
nuclear transmutation. Radioactive decay, also known as nuclear decay
or radioactivity, is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable
atom loses energy by emitting ionizing radiation. A material that
spontaneously emits this kind of radiation - which includes the
emission of alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays â€” is
considered radioactive.

The geiger counter tube and circuit registers and makes audible and
visible the local presence of this beta and gamma ionising radiation
caused by forms of radioactive decay within active materials such as
Uraninite embedded within the ERD/\gamma crystal cube. Each flash of
the LED, and accompanying trigger pulse (before any division) means
that a particle has been intercepted by the geiger tube, causing a
pulse of electricity to flow through the tube, and triggering an
event.

The interval between detected decay events presents a high entropy
source of randomness. Although we know that in 24 days half of our
stock of Thorium-234 atoms (itself a decay product of Uranium-238 in
our sample with a half-life of 4.5 billion years) will have decayed
into Protactinium-234, we have no way of knowing exactly when an atom
will decay, producing as part of this energetic transformation a beta
particle which will strike our geiger tube and trigger a musical (or
otherwise) event. We can see the natural decay chain of our
Uranium-238 above.

However we need to accumulate entropy to avoid any baising from the
physical characteristics of the tube or circuit. To do this, the
digital part of the module accumulates random bits from the low bits
of each interval into bytes and uses these as the source for the
random voltages. 

* Layout

\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{images/annotatedgamma.png}

** Modes from selected switches (0 is switch up):

*** 4 CV modes: CV out (0-5v):

- 00- Scaled random voltage every speed (discrete) delta T time = from 10Hz to 120 seconds
- 01- Scaled random voltage every random emission scaled by speed time = 10Hz to approx 120 seconds
- 10- Low entropy every divided emission by speed time = 100Hz to approx 80 seconds
- 11- Trigger in produces last random voltage (note that if triggers are too fast entropy is severely reduced)

*** 2 trigger modes: trigger out (5v, 200 uS) on random time interval/pulse divider:

- 00/01- Random time scaled by random scale scaled by speed scale = 100Hz to approx 30 seconds
- 10/11- Random time scaled by speed scale = 100Hz to approx 80 seconds

Also note that the delay/timing for each mode is only reset on the end
of each pulse, random voltage (so you may have to wait until the next
event in the sequence). All CV inputs are scaled by the corresponding
pots. If speedscale pot is set to zero (far left) CV in will have no
effect. If it is set far right it will effect across the whole speed
range

* Tech specs

12HP, 35mA at +12V, 4mA at -12V, 0mA at 5v. 2 CV inputs(0-5v), 1
trigger input(edge trigger), 1 CV output(0-5v), 1 trigger output
(5v at 200uS), 35mm deep.

* Suggested uses and notes
 
\includegraphics[width=.3\linewidth]{images/backpower.png}

 *red stripe or -12V DOWN towards the bottom of the unit*

\noindent Simply wire up the power connector (red/-12V to the bottom
of the unit when facing the back) and connect CVs and trigger as
necessary. Do not touch the Geiger tube (the long bronze cylinder) or
move fingers very close as this will effect the entropy readings.

ERD/\gamma is suited for envelopes, filters and all manner of modular
re-entropising. The non-deterministic nature of the module also
renders it suitable for both EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena)
experimentation (pair one or two with a Grendel Formant or forthcoming
ERD/WORM for example) and advanced psychic and parapsychological
research (Global Consciousness project, pre-sentiment).

* Risks and disclaimer

\noindent In regular use, the ERD/\gamma module presents no health
hazards. The radioactive source is small and encased in resin to
prevent any contamination by way of dust. It is also of reasonably low
decay activity and the distance of operator from the source reduces
considerably an already very minor radiation dose. The embedded
radioactive source should not be removed from the device or tampered
with in any way. The geiger tube requires a very low current, high
voltage power supply which is not in any way dangerous but contact
should be avoided with the back of the board.

Despite the lack of any health risks associated with the normal use of
this device, the manufacturer accepts no responsibility for any health
issues associated with both the regular or un-anticipated uses of this
module.
